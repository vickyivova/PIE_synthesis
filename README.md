# PIE_synthesis
Modified version of the IMS-Toucan toolkit by Florian Lux. It uses learned representations of articulatory features to synthesis zero-shot languages. We use this ability to synthesise Proto-Indo-European, the extinct ancient ancient ancestor of many modern languages, that has been reconstructed through comparative linguistics.
